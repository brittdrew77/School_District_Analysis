# School_District_Analysis
## 1. Overview of The School District Analysis
There was evidence of academic dishonesty from ninth grade students at Thomas High School. I had to remove all those reading and math test scores for ninth graders at Thomas. After removing those scores I want to see how the data overall was affected by this change. I ran through the same analyses again with this change in data and compared it to the original. 
## 2. Results
* How is the district summary affected? <br />
In the district summary we can observe that the average math score was lower than before. It decreased by 0.1.

* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools? <br />
When replacing the scores, Thomas High School has the second best overall passing percentage compared to the other schools in the district. This is the same placement as before replacing the scores.

* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  * Math and reading scores by grade <br />
  The only difference here is that the average math and the average reading scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School will show up as "nan". This means that there are no scores for the ninth graders, therefore, no data to display.

  The row for $631 - 645 was slightly affect by the change, since Thomas High School falls into this spending bin. Overall passing percentage, percentage passing math, and math average were all lower. Percentage passing reading and average reading score were higher.
