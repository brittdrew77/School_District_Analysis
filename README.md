# School_District_Analysis
## 1. Overview of The School District Analysis
There was evidence of academic dishonesty from ninth grade students at Thomas High School. I had to remove all those reading and math test scores for ninth graders at Thomas. After removing those scores I want to see how the data overall was affected by this change. I ran through the same analyses again with this change in data and compared it to the original. 
## 2. Results
* How is the district summary affected?
In the district summary we can observe that the average math score was lower than before. It decreased by 0.1. 
* How is the school summary affected?

* How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
* How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
  * Math and reading scores by grade
  * Scores by school spending
  * Scores by school size
  * Scores by school type
